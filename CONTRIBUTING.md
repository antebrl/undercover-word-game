## Recommendations
1. Commit Descriptive Messages
Provide clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of the changes made in the commit.

2. Stage Relevant Changes
Only stage and commit changes that are relevant to the current task or issue being addressed. Avoid committing unrelated changes.

3. Test Locally
Test your changes locally before committing to ensure they function as intended and do not introduce errors or bugs.

4. Pull Before Push
Always pull the latest changes from the remote repository before pushing your changes to avoid conflicts and ensure your local repository is up-to-date.

5. Resolve Conflicts Promptly
If conflicts arise during the pull or merge process, resolve them promptly and communicate with team members if necessary.

6. Follow Coding Standards
Maintain coding standards and style guidelines established for the project or organization. Ensure consistency in formatting and code structure.

7. Review Changes
Review your changes before committing to catch any mistakes or overlooked issues. Consider doing a code review.

8. Include Relevant Documentation
Update relevant documentation, such as README files or inline comments, to reflect any changes made and provide context for future developers.

9. Avoid Pushing Sensitive Information
Be cautious not to push sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or confidential data, to the repository. Utilize environment variables or configuration files for such information.

10. Monitor Continuous Integration (CI) Status
Ensure that any automated tests or CI pipelines associated with the repository pass successfully before pushing changes. Fix failing tests or build failures promptly.
